oneTRANSPORT iOS SDK
====================

## [What data is available?](ios_available_data.html)
This SDK gives your app access to:

1. real-time road transport data from four counties in England: Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire.

2. real-time road transport data for Birmingham

3. Historical data sets from race weekends at Silverstone
circuit during the Formula One Grand Prix and Moto GP races in 2016.

## [Adding the SDK to your app](ios_adding_sdk_to_your_app.html)
There are two frameworks to add to your project and some configuration work to be done in the AppDelegate.

## [Request API](ios_requests.html)
For the latest road traffic data we provide a simple API that returns oneTRANSPORT resources as arrays of objects.

## [CoreData queries](ios_queries.html)
If you run requests, it is then possible to apply CoreData queries to the data sets

## [FlorenceSDK - the iOS oneM2M SDK](ios_florence.html)
oneTRANSPORT is based on an implementation of the oneM2M standard called Florence.  Lower level routines to access individual containers and content instances are available through this SDK.

## [Troubleshooting](ios_troubleshooting.html)
Is your app not working? There is a check list of things to do.
